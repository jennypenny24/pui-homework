                  the main issue is that many do not know how to manage this p.a. effectively.

            <div class="h4 section-title-project-little">we discovered through our initial research 
              that social support itself can help people shift their performance anxiety to a more optimal level, 
              but it can also help indirectly to support individuals in the use of other coping strategies. during the design process, 
              we kept this knowledge in mind and heavily integrated it into our game mechanics.

            <div class="h4 section-title-project-little">based on our research, we have confirmed that the direction of our game is collaborative rather than competitive. for the game scenario, we generated extensive ideas with our interviewees such as talent show, singing performance, drama performance, harry potter quidditch team, delivering a new product, driving, etc. 
              because we want to distance the scenario a little bit from the realistic events (exams, interviews, presentations) but make it also accessible for everyone to resonate with, 
              we finally decided to dive into the idea of collaborative school performance.</div>

            <div class="h4 section-title-project-little">
              after brainstorming individually, we fleshed out our ideas as a group on miro and expanded our idea in different dimensions such as learning objectives, settings, nouns, verbs, rules, dynamics, etc.

              we enriched our design by creating 40+ action cards (including practice cards, relief cards, and motivation cards),
              20+ event cards, 5 character cards with different personas and different initial values of performance anxiety and task mastery. 
              we also designed the value changes of each card carefully in order to keep the game balance.

              players not only learn about some p.a. relief and motivating methods that exist,

              they learn the methods by reading their action cards, and more so by reading them out loud (improves memory). 
              players learn that these methods affect people differently as different characters are more positively impacted by certain strategies.

                provides a space for people to talk about performance anxiety in a safe and appropriate way. 
                speaking through the lens of their characters, players practice the act of initiating and engaging in 
                conversations about mental health which is something that some struggle with. 
                our role play helps increase empathy for those who may be unlike ourselves and 
                we are happy to see the game teach players the nuances of p.a. regulation.
